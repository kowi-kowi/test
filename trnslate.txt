eProcurement instructions 
involve using online software 
for business purchasing, 
streamlining needs identification, 
supplier sourcing, 
bidding/tendering, 
evaluation, 
contracting, 
and payment through digital workflows, 
requiring user registration 
(like EU Login or portal-specific IDs), 
secure login 
(often with digital certificates/DSC), 
and following steps 
to find calls, 
upload documents, 
and submit electronically, 
ensuring all stages 
are managed digitally 
for efficiency and cost savings.
